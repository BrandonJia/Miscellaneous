This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/H.J. Jia/Desktop/BMI.csv")
attach(data)
model <- lm(formula = weight ~1)
summary(model)
```
```{r}
model2 <- lm(formula = weight ~ factor(gender))
summary(model2)
```
```{r}
model3 <- lm(formula = log(bmi) ~ log(weight) + log(height), data = data)
summary(model3)
```


```{r}
model4 <- lm(formula = log(bmi) ~ log(weight)*gender + log(height)*gender)
summary(model4)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
